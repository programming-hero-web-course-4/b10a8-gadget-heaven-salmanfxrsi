## React Fundamentals Used in the Project:
- **JSX**: Used for structuring UI components in a declarative syntax.
- **Components**: Functional components used throughout the project to break down the UI into reusable and manageable parts.
- **Props**: Data is passed from parent to child components using props.
- **State**: The local state is managed with React's `useState` hook, especially for cart and wishlist data.
- **useEffect**: Used to perform side effects such as fetching data, updating the page title, etc.
- **React Router**: Handles navigation between different pages of the website.
- **Hooks**:
  - `useState`: For local state management (e.g., cart, wishlist).
  - `useEffect`: For side effects like updating the page title or fetching data from an API.
  - `useContext`: For accessing global state from Context API.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying UI elements based on certain conditions (e.g., "Out of Stock" labels).
